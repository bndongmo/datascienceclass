# Lab 4: Text Processing and Similarity Search
---
* **Assigned: TODO.**
* **Due: Apr. 3rd, 11:59:59 PM ET.**

* **Learning Objective**: Learn basic text processing, basic similarity metrics, and use similarity search to build a Q/A system.
* **Deliverables**: You will build a simple Q/A system using various similarity metrics and search tools.

## 1. Colab Setup

For this lab, we will be using Google Colab, which is a free hosted Jupyter Notebook service.

Please read the brief instructions in the first cell of the Lab 4 notebook (linked below). You will need to create a copy of our notebook in your personal Google account. You can then work on the copy. (Note that MIT offers a free Google workspace account with your MIT email).

The Colab notebook for Lab 4 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uI0D6wpPJJF8zNEldt5cCZXrKgGS6108/view?usp=sharing).

## 2. Lab Overview
In this lab, you will use some of the text similarity concepts presented in the lecture to build a basic question-and-answer service.
All the tasks and questions are described in `6.S079_Lab4.ipynb`. Your job is to fill out the notebook.

### Running Updates
This section is a rough copy of the running updates post on Piazza. We will do our best to keep the Lab README as up-to-date as possible with the Piazza post.

## 3. Submission Instructions
When you've finished Lab 4 and are ready to submit, you will first need to download your .ipynb file. To do this, go to `File > Download > Download .ipynb`. See the reference image below:

### Submitting as an Individual

Submit the filled and executed `6.S079_Lab4.ipynb` file to Gradescope.

### Submitting as a Group
Have one member of the group submit the `6.S079_Lab4.ipynb` file to Gradescope. **The member who submits the assignment must then add their partner as a group member on the Gradescope submission: [details](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members).**
